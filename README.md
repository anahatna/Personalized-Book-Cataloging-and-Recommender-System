# *My Virtual Bookshelf*
##### Anahat Nagra
Java Application Using OOD

## Overview

The purpose of a virtual book journal is so the user is able to keep
track of the books they have read and be
recommended similar books to the ones they like.


#### *Further details*:

As mentioned in the overview, the main functionality of this app is to
allow the people using it to have an organized record of the books that they've read.
As they record their most recent read, the user will be prompted to give the book a personal rating out of 5 stars, 
select the genre(s) of that book, and give a short review. After adding the book to their record,
they will also have to option to be recommended books that they might like (based on their highest rated genre)


#### *Who will use this app?*
- Book lovers! (so they can keep track of the books they've been reading)
- People who want to read more and be given recommendations based on they are interested in

The reason I chose to create this project is because I am a book lover myself.
I find myself keeping track of all the books I've read in an actual journal (which can be tedious) 
so I thought it would be interesting/useful to create an application that not only keeps a record of
everything that I've read, but also suggests other books to read.
This is an application that can be a very helpful tool used to arrange and organize a readers books!
